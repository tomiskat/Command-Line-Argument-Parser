It allows its users to define the expected arguments, parse them, validate them and obtain their values in specified types. Simplicity is paramount. There is a simple API with specific classes and fluent syntax. This document provides a high-level overview of the project. Detailed description of individual parts of the project is in the Javadoc reference documentation.
